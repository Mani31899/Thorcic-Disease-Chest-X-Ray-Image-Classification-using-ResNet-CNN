# Analysis and Classification of Thoracic Diseases in Chest X-Rays using ResNet CNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify thoracic diseases in chest X-ray images. By employing ResNet architecture, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of disease prediction. Additionally, it incorporates various image preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance. The final model is deployed into a web application for user-friendly access and utilization.

## Key Components
- **Deep Learning Model**: Development of a ResNet CNN model to identify patterns in chest X-ray images and predict disease malignity.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Implementation of adaptive histogram equalization, image filtering, and data augmentation techniques using Python libraries such as Sci-kit Image, OpenCV, and NumPy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Customization of parameters including learning rate, optimizer, model architecture, epochs, and loss function to optimize prediction accuracy.
- **Model Deployment**: Integration of the trained model into a web application using React JS and Python's Flask framework, allowing users to upload X-ray images for real-time disease prediction.

## Project Step by Step WorkFlow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Chest X-ray images are collected and prepared for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**: Image preprocessing techniques such as adaptive histogram equalization, filtering, and augmentation are applied to enhance image quality and variability.
3. **Model Training**: A ResNet CNN model is constructed and trained on the preprocessed data, with extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
